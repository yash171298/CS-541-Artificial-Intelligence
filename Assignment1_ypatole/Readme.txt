The zip file Assignment1_ypatole.zip includes total 6 files which includes the following:
1)Problem1 Logistic regression code in .py and .ipynb
2)Problem2 K_mean clustering using elbow method code in .py and .ipynb
3)Kmeans Elbow.jpg
4)Readme.txt


Problem1: This code includes implementation of logistic regression from scratch. The data is preprocessed first in this code as explained in the question. While implementing this algorithm I have implemented all the ways as you suggested in our mail conversation. Which includes two main features I used to improve accuracy i.e. TF-idf and BOW (Bag of Words) from scratch using no scientific libraries. While as of now the code works using only TF-idf from scratch using no libraries. I have implemented the logistic regression using sigmoid function and training the data for more than 10000s times. 

I have already had a long conversation via mail (ypatole@stevens.edu-Yash P.) where we discussed about my possible working and my accuracy. I have tried attempting all the methods you suggested to cross check my data. I used sklearn's tf-idf and logistic regression. You can find that commented in my code including extraction feature BOW which is commented too. I have submitted my code by spliting training data and test data into 70:30 as you suggested to improve my accuracy which increased my accuracy by 3%. 
My accuracy ranges from 64.5% to 68.7 while having 68.7 highest.


Problem2: This code includes implementation of K-means Clustering algorithm from scratch using no scientific libraries. I have calculated Euclidien Distance too from scratch between the centroids. Performed 10 iterations to have a better accuracy and a proper K value.
K value = 5
While the elbow plot image is also attached with the code.

Thank you,
Please let me know if I am unclear in any part of the assignment,
