Topic: Assignment 3
Course: CS541
 

The zip file Assignment3_ypatole.zip includes files which includes the following:
1) ngram-model.py
2) Plot1.py and Plot2.py
3) text_generation_output.py
4) images of the plots after training
5) reddit.out and ted.out


1) ngram-model.py having the model is the unigram model based on uniform probability and frequencies.
Where ngram model is trained for reddit.txt as the train file and ted.txt as another trainfile.

2) Plot1.py and Plots2.py has the bar graph plot which shows plots for 4 outputs where a) reddit file is used as train file b) ted file is used as train file c) reddit file used as train after smoothing is plotted d) ted file used as train after smoothing is plotted

3) the n-gram model after performing Laplace smoothing with ted.txt as the train filetext_generation_out.py is a file to generate output generating 500 words. This file is then saved as reddit.out and ted.out.

The code works good and outputs are already tested. Please let me know if anything else is needed. For reference I have attached all the ipynb file for the same.

Perplexity for the test.ted.txt file: 53681
Perplexity for the test.news.txt file: 53680
Perplexity for the test.ted.reddit file: 53681

The scores did not have that big changes. The files have been tested for n=1 to 7.

Thank you,
