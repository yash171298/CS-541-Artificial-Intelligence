The zip file Assignment2_ypatole.zip includes files which includes the following:
1)Problem1 UCS and A* algorithm done from scratch as ipynb
2)Problem2 Beam_search algorithm with graph and attempted valid.fra file
3)nodes.csv and edge.csv
4)Readme.txt

1) Uniform Cost Search algorithm for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph. While this earch is completed without using heuristic values or graphs.

2) Unlike UCS A* algorithm requires heuristic values to calculate the path between two nodes. A* makes powerful use of weighted graphs in its implementation and gets efficient path required.

3) Beam_search algorithm is an algorithm which uses heuristic values in its implementation, it progresses level by level and moves downwards using the best K value attained by deriving probabilities.


The code works good and outputs are already tested. Please let me know if anything else is needed.

Thank you,
